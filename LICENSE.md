# Caution!
### Please read the terms of use carefully!

Depending on the intended use case the software terms differ:

1. **Personal & Educational Use** => Permitted with publishing restrictions
2. **Commercial Use** => Permitted for a 30-day evaluation period only

I wish for this software to be available free of charge for personal & educational use while getting paid for commercial use.

I provide the software in its entirety to the public, knowing full well that any attempt of trying to "protect" digital content is fruitless.

Instead, I plea to and believe in your kindness and honesty as I have to make a living off this Software and I only want to do business with kind and honest customers to begin with.
